# From Meetings to PRDs in Minutes: A Product Owner's Guide

If you're a Product Owner, you know the feeling: a productive stakeholder meeting ends, and now you have hours of documentation ahead. The conversation was rich with insights, decisions, and next steps—but translating all that into structured PRDs, user stories, and follow-up emails is another story entirely.

**What if you could skip the translation step entirely?**

## The Documentation Burden

Product Owners spend an estimated 30% of their time on documentation tasks. That's time not spent on:

- Strategic planning
- Stakeholder alignment
- Customer research
- Team collaboration

The irony? The more meetings you have, the less time you have to act on what was discussed.

## Sound Familiar?

### Hours Lost to Documentation

After every meeting, you're stuck writing PRDs, user stories, and follow-up emails instead of focusing on strategy. The mental context-switching alone is exhausting.

### Context Gets Lost

Important decisions and nuances from stakeholder conversations slip through the cracks when you're taking notes manually. Was it Sarah who suggested the API change, or Mike? Did we decide to defer that feature or just discuss it?

### Scattered Across Tools

Meeting notes in Notion, action items in Slack, decisions in email. Nothing is connected or structured. Finding that one decision from three weeks ago becomes an archaeological expedition.

## A Better Way: Speech-to-Structure

Neural Summary transforms how Product Owners work by turning conversations directly into structured deliverables:

### Sprint Planning → Structured Notes

Record your planning sessions and get structured sprint notes with priorities, owners, and dependencies automatically extracted. No more scribbling during standup.

Upload your Zoom or Teams recordings directly. Neural Summary handles audio up to 5GB and identifies different speakers automatically.

### Stakeholder Interviews → PRDs

Capture requirements directly from conversations. Generate PRDs and feature specs without the manual translation work. The AI understands product management context and formats output accordingly.

### User Research → Insights Repository

Extract insights, pain points, and opportunities from user interviews. Build your research repository automatically with tagged, searchable content.

### Customer Calls → Follow-ups

Turn customer conversations into feature requests, bug reports, and professional follow-up emails. Never miss a customer commitment again.

## Templates Built for Product Owners

Neural Summary includes templates specifically designed for product management workflows:

| Template | What It Creates |
|----------|-----------------|
| **PRD Generator** | Full product requirements from conversations |
| **User Story Creator** | "As a user..." format with acceptance criteria |
| **Sprint Notes** | Priorities, owners, and blockers |
| **Release Notes** | Customer-ready changelog from demos |
| **Decision Record** | ADR format for technical decisions |
| **Stakeholder Update** | Executive summary emails |
| **Research Synthesis** | Insights from user interviews |
| **Retro Summary** | Actions and learnings captured |

## See the Transformation

Here's what happens when you run a 45-minute sprint planning meeting through Neural Summary:

**Before: Scattered conversation**
> "So the auth refactor, that's definitely the priority this sprint, right? Sarah's been blocked on that..."
>
> "Yeah, and we need to figure out the dashboard performance thing, Mike mentioned it's getting slow with the new data..."
>
> "What about the API docs? Alex said customers are complaining but I don't know if it's urgent..."

**After: Structured output in 30 seconds**

### Sprint 24 Planning Summary

**High Priority**
- User authentication refactor (Owner: Sarah, blocked)
- Dashboard performance optimization (Owner: Mike)

**Medium Priority**
- API documentation update (Owner: Alex)
- Customer feedback review

**Decisions Made**
- Auth refactor takes precedence over new features
