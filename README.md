# Neural Summary

**Voice-to-Output Creation Platform**

**Speak. We'll remember.**

Neural Summary transforms conversations into work-ready documents — effortlessly. Turn brainstorms into product specs, interviews into articles, client calls into follow-up emails, and vision talks into strategy documents. An AI-powered platform that goes beyond transcription to create deliverables.

### Core Value Proposition
**"Speaking becomes creating"** - Turn thinking (conversations) into working (documents) without the friction of manual writing, formatting, and structuring.

## Design Language: Calm Intelligence

Our interface embodies a futuristic-minimal aesthetic that blends human warmth with machine precision:

- **Tone**: Serene, confident, intelligent
- **Style**: Minimal, cinematic, spatial, human-centric
- **Visual DNA**: White space, soft gradients, precise typography, subtle motion
- **Philosophy**: Technology that listens rather than shouts — invisible, yet deeply present

*The visual equivalent of AI that feels effortless.*

## Positioning

Neural Summary is a **voice-to-output creation platform**, not a traditional transcription or meeting notes tool.

We transform conversations into work-ready documents—product specs, articles, strategies, emails—using AI that understands context and generates structured deliverables. Our upcoming **AI interview feature** will ask questions to extract ideas and turn them into polished outputs.

**We're not competing with:**
- Meeting note tools (Otter, Fireflies)
- Simple transcription services
- Traditional dictation software

**We enable:**
- **Product Managers** to turn brainstorms into specs in 5 minutes
- **Founders** to convert vision talks into strategy docs for teams
- **Content Creators** to transform interviews into publish-ready articles
- **Sales Leaders** to generate follow-up emails from client calls instantly

**The difference:** We don't just capture what was said—we create what needs to be done.

## Why Neural Summary?

**Your AI that listens, understands, and creates — so you can think, lead, and deliver.**

### The Problem We Solve
Your best ideas get lost in translation. You think in conversations. You work in documents. Between the two: hours of typing, formatting, restructuring. Professionals waste valuable time converting spoken thoughts into written deliverables—product specs, strategy documents, articles, follow-up emails.

### Our Solution
Neural Summary transforms the entire process from conversation to creation:
- **Save Time**: Turn 30-minute brainstorms into complete product specs or strategy docs
- **Create Deliverables**: Generate work-ready documents, not just transcripts—specs, articles, emails, strategies
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Get 15+ specialized analysis templates (Executive Brief, Sales Analysis, Training Materials, etc.)
- **Never Miss Details**: Capture every decision, action item, and insight automatically with 99.5% accuracy
- **Share Effortlessly**: Send polished documents to your team with one click
- **Work Globally**: Translate documents into 15 languages instantly
- **Privacy-First**: Audio files are processed by secure transcription services and **never stored** - deleted within seconds after processing

### Privacy & Security You Can Trust

**Your audio is never stored on our servers.** When you upload a recording, it's sent directly to secure, enterprise-grade transcription services for processing, then **immediately deleted** - typically within seconds. We only retain the text transcript and analysis results.

This makes Neural Summary ideal for sensitive meetings:
- **Legal consultations** - Client confidentiality maintained
- **Medical discussions** - HIPAA-compliant workflow ready
- **Executive briefings** - Strategic discussions remain private
- **HR conversations** - Employee privacy protected
- **Research interviews** - Participant data secured

**Zero-knowledge architecture**: Your data is encrypted in transit and at rest. We process only what's necessary and delete audio immediately after transcription.

### Who Uses Neural Summary
Trusted by legal, medical, research, and executive teams where every word matters. From solo professionals to enterprise organizations, our platform scales with your needs while maintaining enterprise-grade security and compliance.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/transcribe.git
cd transcribe
```

2. Set up environment variables:

Create `.env` in the root directory:
```bash
# AI Services

ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=your_assemblyai_key
GPT_MODEL_PREFERENCE=gpt-5  # Options: gpt-5, gpt-5-mini
QUALITY_MODE=premium  # Options: premium, balanced

# Firebase Admin SDK
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_service_account_email
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=project-id.firebasestorage.app

# Email Service (Gmail SMTP)
GMAIL_AUTH_USER=your-email@gmail.com  # Primary Gmail account
GMAIL_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com  # Email shown in FROM field

npm run dev           # Run frontend and backend (without Redis)
npm run build         # Production build for all packages
npm run start         # Start production servers
```

### Service Management
```bash
npm run redis:start   # Start Redis Docker container
npm run redis:stop    # Stop Redis container
npm run redis:check   # Verify Redis connectivity
npm run build:shared  # Build shared TypeScript types package
```

### Docker Commands
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up    # Run development stack in Docker
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up   # Run production stack locally
docker-compose logs -f                          # View container logs

   - **Quick** - Restart services without rebuild
   - **Service-only** - Deploy specific services (api, web, redis, traefik)

**Rollback:**
```bash
# Via GitHub Actions
Go to Actions → Run "Rollback Deployment" workflow
```

**Emergency Manual Deployment:**
```bash
./deploy-manual.sh              # Backup script for emergencies
./deploy-manual.sh --quick      # Quick restart
./deploy-manual.sh --service api,web  # Deploy specific services
```

**Required GitHub Secrets:**
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` - SSH key for server access
