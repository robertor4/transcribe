# Security Audit Report: Audio File Deletion Implementation

**Date**: August 7, 2025  
**System**: Transcribe Web Application  
**Focus**: Automatic deletion of uploaded audio recordings for data privacy and security  
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

## Executive Summary

The transcription system now automatically deletes original uploaded audio files from Firebase Storage immediately after processing (both success and failure cases), significantly improving data privacy and security posture. This implementation ensures uploaded recordings are not retained beyond their processing lifecycle.

## Current Data Flow & Storage Analysis

### 1. Upload & Initial Storage
```
User Upload → Firebase Storage → Signed URL Generated → Database Record Created
Location: firebase://audio/{userId}/{timestamp}_{filename}
Duration: Temporary (deleted after processing)
```

### 2. Processing Lifecycle
```
Queue Job Created → Audio Downloaded → Temporary Files Created → Processing → Cleanup
Temp Location: /apps/api/temp/{timestamp}_audio.{ext}
Duration: Processing time only (< 30 minutes typically)
```

### 3. Post-Processing State
```
Results Saved → Original File Deleted → Database Updated → Job Completed
Storage: Only transcript/summary text files remain
```

## What Gets Stored vs. What Gets Deleted

### ✅ DELETED (Secure)
1. **Original Audio File** - Deleted from Firebase Storage after processing
2. **Temporary Files** - Deleted from local server storage after use  
3. **Audio Chunks** - Deleted after chunk processing completes
4. **Download Cache** - No persistent caching of audio data

### ⚠️ RETAINED (by design)
1. **Database Metadata** - File name, size, upload date, status (in Firestore)
2. **Transcript Text** - Stored as text in database for user access
3. **Summary Text** - Stored as markdown in database for user access  
4. **File URL Reference** - The signed URL remains in database but points to deleted file

## Security Implementation Details

### File Deletion Points
1. **Success Case** (`transcription.processor.ts:97-116`)
   ```typescript
   // After transcript and summary generation
   await this.firebaseService.deleteFile(fileUrl);
   ```

2. **Failure Case** (`transcription.processor.ts:135-149`) 
   ```typescript
   // Even if transcription fails
   await this.firebaseService.deleteFile(fileUrl);
   ```

### Error Handling
- File deletion failures are logged as warnings, not errors
- Processing continues successfully even if deletion fails
- No retry mechanism for deletion (fail-safe approach)

### Cleanup Coverage
- ✅ Original upload file (Firebase Storage)
- ✅ Temporary processing files (local server)
- ✅ Audio chunk files (for large files)
- ✅ Memory buffers cleared automatically

## Identified Security Gap

### Issue: Dead URL References
**Problem**: The `fileUrl` field in the database still contains the signed URL to the now-deleted file.

**Risk Level**: 🟡 LOW  
- URL no longer provides access to deleted content
- Firebase returns 404 for deleted files
- No data exposure, but creates confusion in UI/API

**Recommendation**: Update database record to clear or mark `fileUrl` as deleted

## Compliance & Privacy Benefits

### ✅ Data Minimization  
Original audio files are not retained beyond processing requirements

### ✅ Purpose Limitation
Files are only stored for the duration needed to complete transcription

### ✅ Right to Deletion
User deletions now remove all associated audio content  

### ✅ Security by Design
Deletion occurs automatically without manual intervention

### ✅ Audit Trail
All file operations are comprehensively logged

## Risk Assessment

| Risk Category | Before | After | Mitigation |
|---------------|--------|-------|------------|
| Data Breach Impact | 🔴 HIGH | 🟢 LOW | No audio files to breach |
| Storage Costs | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🟢 LOW | Files deleted immediately |
| Compliance | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🟢 HIGH | Privacy-by-design |
| User Trust | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🟢 HIGH | Clear data handling |

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Low Priority)
1. **Update Database Schema**: Clear `fileUrl` field post-deletion
2. **UI Updates**: Show "File deleted" status instead of broken URLs
3. **API Documentation**: Document file deletion behavior

### Future Enhancements  
1. **Deletion Confirmation**: User notification when files are deleted
2. **Retention Policy**: Configurable retention periods for different tiers
3. **Secure Deletion**: Cryptographic erasure for additional security

## Verification Steps

To verify the implementation works:

1. **Upload Test File**: Submit audio file for transcription
2. **Check Initial Storage**: Verify file exists in Firebase Storage  
3. **Monitor Processing**: Watch logs for deletion messages
4. **Verify Deletion**: Confirm file no longer accessible via URL
5. **Check Results**: Ensure transcript/summary still available

## Conclusion

The automatic file deletion implementation successfully addresses the primary security concern of persistent audio file storage. Original recordings are now deleted immediately after processing, significantly improving the application's privacy and security posture while maintaining full functionality.
