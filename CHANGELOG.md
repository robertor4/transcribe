### Changed
- **Enhanced AI Service Logging**: Improved log messages to show which AI models and services are being used
  - Transcription logs now specify "AssemblyAI (speaker diarization + language detection)" or "OpenAI Whisper API (with auto-chunking)"
  - Analysis logs show GPT model selection: "GPT-5 (summary) + GPT-5/GPT-5-mini (secondary)" with quality mode
  - Translation logs specify "using GPT-5-mini" for clarity
  - Fallback logs explicitly mention "OpenAI Whisper API" when AssemblyAI fails
  - Locations: `apps/api/src/transcription/transcription.service.ts:359-361,447-449,685-687,1783-1785`
- **Auto-generated Transcription Titles**: Optimized for better scanning and readability
  - Changed auto-generated titles from long descriptive headings to concise 5-7 word titles
  - Added `generateShortTitle()` method using gpt-5-mini to intelligently condense extracted H1 headings
  - Skips API call if heading is already 7 words or less (cost optimization)
  - Falls back to smart truncation (first 7 words + ellipsis) if API fails

  - Locations: `DEPLOYMENT.md:200-223`, `CLAUDE.md:415-478`
- **Shared Transcript UI Simplification**: Removed Details and More Analyses tabs from shared transcripts
  - Details tab (processing information) only relevant to transcript author, not recipients
  - More Analyses tab (on-demand generation) requires authentication and shouldn't be exposed in public shares
  - Both tabs now hidden when `readOnlyMode={true}` is set on AnalysisTabs component
  - Locations: `apps/web/components/AnalysisTabs.tsx:430,448,706,722`

### Fixed
- **Shared Transcript Details Tab Error**: Fixed runtime error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'charAt')" on shared transcript Details tab
  - Made Status field conditional since SharedTranscriptionView type doesn't include status field
  - Details tab now gracefully handles missing status for shared/read-only transcriptions
  - Location: `apps/web/components/TranscriptionDetails.tsx:40`
  - Note: Details tab subsequently removed entirely from shared views (see Changed section above)
- **Timeline View UI Spacing Issues**: Fixed margin and padding issues in transcript timeline view
  - Added proper bottom spacing (`mb-6`) between consecutive speaker cards for better visual separation
  - Increased speaker card padding from `p-3` to `p-4` for better content breathing room

  - Made dark mode background transparent to blend with page background
  - Locations: `apps/web/components/TranscriptTimeline.tsx:187`, `:307`, `:321`, `:351`, `:367`
- **Multiple File Upload UI State Management**: Resolved confusing UI behavior during batch file uploads
  - Issue: When uploading 3+ files individually, UI initially showed incorrect filenames, duplicate progress updates, and flickering cards before eventually correcting itself
  - Root cause: Synchronous rapid-fire state updates causing race conditions between API fetches, WebSocket events, and UI re-renders
  - Solution:
    - Added 150ms sequential delays between upload callbacks to prevent cascade of simultaneous state updates
    - Implemented 300ms debounce on `lastCompletedId` updates to consolidate multiple API calls into one
    - Added progress validation to ensure WebSocket updates only affect correct transcription cards
    - Added subscription tracking to prevent duplicate WebSocket subscriptions
  - Impact: Each file now displays correct filename immediately, progress bars update independently per file, no flickering or multiple re-renders
  - Locations: `apps/web/components/FileUploader.tsx:187-195`, `apps/web/app/[locale]/dashboard/page.tsx:164-191`, `apps/web/components/TranscriptionList.tsx:291-309`, `apps/web/lib/websocket.ts:221-237`
- **Traefik Default Certificate Issue**: Resolved self-signed certificate problem
  - Root cause: Missing ACME_EMAIL environment variable prevented Let's Encrypt registration

  - Added diagnostic script to quickly identify and fix certificate issues
  - Removed insecure dashboard that could expose misconfiguration details

  - **Data Lifecycle**: Translations automatically cleaned up when analysis is deleted
  - **Testing**: Comprehensive e2e test suite (`apps/api/test/translation.e2e-spec.ts`) verifies full translation flow
- **Stripe Subscription Flow**: Simplified to webhook-only approach for both development and production

  - Updated subscription flow documentation to reflect webhook-only approach
  - Eliminates code path divergence between dev and production
  - Prevents quota gaming vulnerability from repeated manual syncs

### Fixed
- **Translation Missing Analyses**: Fixed translations returning empty analyses object

  - Updated to check for `coreAnalyses` first, then fall back to `analyses` (for backwards compatibility)
  - Now correctly translates summary, action items, communication styles, and other analyses
  - Fixes issue where translated transcriptions showed no summary or analysis content

  - Upgrade button now always visible for free tier users, not just when approaching quota limits
  - Makes upgrade path more discoverable for users with low usage
- **Usage Reset on Subscription Upgrade**: Fixed usage not resetting when upgrading to paid subscription
  - When user upgrades from free to paid tier, usage now resets to 0 (hours, transcriptions, analyses)
  - Reset date is set to today's date instead of keeping the old free tier reset date
  - Applied via webhook handler (`checkout.session.completed`)
  - Fixes issue where users saw incorrect usage carryover and future reset dates after upgrading
- **Usage Reset Date Format**: Changed date format from ambiguous MM/DD/YYYY to clear dd-MMM-yyyy format
  - Example: "11/1/2025" now displays as "01-Nov-2025"

  - Free tier users can now properly be blocked from uploading files exceeding 30-minute duration limit
  - Free tier users can now be blocked from exceeding 3 transcriptions/month limit
  - Moved quota checks into controller methods (after FileInterceptor) instead of using guards
  - Root cause: Guards run BEFORE interceptors, so file wasn't parsed yet when guard ran
  - Previous approach using `SubscriptionGuard` failed silently because `request.file` was undefined
  - Both `/upload` and `/upload-batch` endpoints now check quotas after file validation
  - Added `estimateDuration()` method to controller for duration estimation
  - Fixes issue where 74-minute file was processed on free account that should have been rejected
  - Fixes issue where users could exceed transcription count limits (e.g., 5/3 transcriptions)
- **Quota Exceeded User Experience**: Replaced generic error messages with beautiful upgrade modals
  - Shows `QuotaExceededModal` when users hit any quota limit (transcriptions, duration, filesize, analyses)
  - Modal displays current usage, limit, tier-specific messaging, and direct link to pricing page
  - Integrated in `MoreAnalysesTab` for on-demand analysis quotas
  - Integrated in `FileUploader` for transcription upload quotas
  - All quota error codes properly detected and mapped to quota types
  - Fixed axios error interceptor to preserve original error structure (was transforming to plain objects)
  - Frontend now correctly detects HTTP 402 status and shows modal instead of generic "Upload failed"

### Fixed
- **Share Page Analysis Display**: Fixed share screen only showing "Full Transcript" tab without analyses
  - Made `AnalysisTabs` component work with both authenticated and unauthenticated contexts
  - Conditionally hide "More Analyses" tab on public share pages (requires authentication)
  - Conditionally hide translation feature on share pages (requires auth tokens)
  - Fixed backend `getSharedTranscription` to support both old format (`analyses`) and new format (`coreAnalyses`)
  - Share pages now correctly display all included analyses (Summary, Action Items, Communication Styles, etc.)
- **Next.js 15 Hydration Error**: Fixed `lang` attribute mismatch in share page layout
  - Root cause: Share page layout dynamically sets `lang` attribute based on `Accept-Language` header
  - Server-side language detection (from header) can differ from client-side, causing hydration mismatch
  - Applied `suppressHydrationWarning` to share layout `<html>` tag to suppress expected mismatch
  - Also applied to root layout per Next.js 15 recommendations
  - Fixed date rendering: moved `new Date().getFullYear()` to client-side useEffect
  - Added `mounted` state check to prevent rendering dates before client hydration
  - Fixed date formatting to ensure consistent output between server and client
