# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Share Page Analysis Display**: Fixed share screen only showing "Full Transcript" tab without analyses
  - Made `AnalysisTabs` component work with both authenticated and unauthenticated contexts
  - Conditionally hide "More Analyses" tab on public share pages (requires authentication)
  - Conditionally hide translation feature on share pages (requires auth tokens)
  - Fixed backend `getSharedTranscription` to support both old format (`analyses`) and new format (`coreAnalyses`)
  - Share pages now correctly display all included analyses (Summary, Action Items, Communication Styles, etc.)
- **Next.js 15 Hydration Error**: Fixed `lang` attribute mismatch in share page layout
  - Root cause: Share page layout dynamically sets `lang` attribute based on `Accept-Language` header
  - Server-side language detection (from header) can differ from client-side, causing hydration mismatch
  - Applied `suppressHydrationWarning` to share layout `<html>` tag to suppress expected mismatch
  - Also applied to root layout per Next.js 15 recommendations
  - Fixed date rendering: moved `new Date().getFullYear()` to client-side useEffect
  - Added `mounted` state check to prevent rendering dates before client hydration
  - Fixed date formatting to ensure consistent output between server and client
