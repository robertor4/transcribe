### Changed
- **User Account Deletion - Stripe Cleanup**: Fixed hard delete to properly clean up Stripe data
  - **CRITICAL FIX**: Implemented actual Stripe subscription cancellation and customer deletion
  - **Previously**: Stripe cleanup was commented out (placeholder code), leaving orphaned customers in Stripe
  - **Now**: Hard delete properly cancels subscriptions immediately and deletes Stripe customer records
  - Added `deleteCustomer()` method to `StripeService` for safe, idempotent customer deletion
  - Injected `StripeService` into `UserService` and added `StripeModule` to `UserModule` imports

  - **Architecture**: Store translations in each `GeneratedAnalysis` document for clean data locality
  - **Backend**: Enhanced `translateTranscription()` to fetch and translate all on-demand analyses
  - **Types**: Added `translations?: { [languageCode: string]: string }` field to `GeneratedAnalysis` interface
  - **Frontend**: Updated `MoreAnalysesTab` to display translated content when language is switched
  - **Parallel Translation**: All on-demand analyses translated in parallel for efficiency
  - **Skip Logic**: Avoids re-translating already translated analyses
  - **Error Handling**: Individual analysis translation failures don't block other translations
  - **User Experience**: Language switching now works seamlessly across all analysis types (core + on-demand)
  - **Data Lifecycle**: Translations automatically cleaned up when analysis is deleted
  - **Testing**: Comprehensive e2e test suite (`apps/api/test/translation.e2e-spec.ts`) verifies full translation flow
- **Stripe Subscription Flow**: Simplified to webhook-only approach for both development and production
  - **REMOVED** manual sync endpoint (`/stripe/sync-subscription`) - eliminated potential security risk
  - **REMOVED** frontend manual sync logic from checkout success page
  - Development now uses Stripe CLI for webhook forwarding (identical to production workflow)
  - Created comprehensive setup guide: `docs/STRIPE_CLI_SETUP.md`
  - Updated subscription flow documentation to reflect webhook-only approach
  - Eliminates code path divergence between dev and production
  - Prevents quota gaming vulnerability from repeated manual syncs
  - Production-ready with no workarounds or temporary solutions

### Fixed
- **Translation Missing Analyses**: Fixed translations returning empty analyses object
  - Translation code was looking for `transcription.analyses` but current structure uses `transcription.coreAnalyses`
  - Updated to check for `coreAnalyses` first, then fall back to `analyses` (for backwards compatibility)
  - Now correctly translates summary, action items, communication styles, and other analyses
  - Fixes issue where translated transcriptions showed no summary or analysis content
- **Stripe Webhook Raw Body Configuration**: Fixed "Missing raw body for webhook verification" error
  - Enabled NestJS `rawBody: true` option to preserve raw body for all requests
  - Raw body stored in `req.rawBody` for Stripe signature verification
  - Uses built-in NestJS feature (not custom Express middleware) to avoid conflicts
  - Fixes issue preventing webhooks from working in development and production
  - Critical for Stripe CLI webhook forwarding and production webhook endpoints
- **UserProfileMenu Upgrade Button Visibility**: Fixed upgrade button not showing for new free tier users
  - Changed condition from `percentUsed >= 70 && tier === 'free'` to just `tier === 'free'`
  - Upgrade button now always visible for free tier users, not just when approaching quota limits
  - Makes upgrade path more discoverable for users with low usage
- **Usage Reset on Subscription Upgrade**: Fixed usage not resetting when upgrading to paid subscription
  - When user upgrades from free to paid tier, usage now resets to 0 (hours, transcriptions, analyses)
  - Reset date is set to today's date instead of keeping the old free tier reset date
  - Applied via webhook handler (`checkout.session.completed`)
  - Fixes issue where users saw incorrect usage carryover and future reset dates after upgrading
- **Usage Reset Date Format**: Changed date format from ambiguous MM/DD/YYYY to clear dd-MMM-yyyy format
  - Example: "11/1/2025" now displays as "01-Nov-2025"
  - Improves clarity for international users and eliminates confusion between US and European date formats
  - Applied to UserProfileMenu usage stats display
- **Stripe Checkout Tax Configuration**: Enabled automatic tax calculation in all environments
  - Configured business address and tax registrations in Stripe dashboard (test mode)
  - Automatic tax now enabled for both test and production environments
  - Added `customer_update.address: 'auto'` to save customer address from checkout
  - Applied to both subscription and PAYG checkout sessions
  - Test environment now matches production for accurate tax testing
- **CRITICAL: Quota Enforcement on Upload**: Fixed quota checking to run AFTER file parsing
  - Free tier users can now properly be blocked from uploading files exceeding 30-minute duration limit
  - Free tier users can now be blocked from exceeding 3 transcriptions/month limit
  - Moved quota checks into controller methods (after FileInterceptor) instead of using guards
  - Root cause: Guards run BEFORE interceptors, so file wasn't parsed yet when guard ran
  - Previous approach using `SubscriptionGuard` failed silently because `request.file` was undefined
  - Both `/upload` and `/upload-batch` endpoints now check quotas after file validation
  - Added `estimateDuration()` method to controller for duration estimation
  - Fixes issue where 74-minute file was processed on free account that should have been rejected
  - Fixes issue where users could exceed transcription count limits (e.g., 5/3 transcriptions)
- **Quota Exceeded User Experience**: Replaced generic error messages with beautiful upgrade modals
  - Shows `QuotaExceededModal` when users hit any quota limit (transcriptions, duration, filesize, analyses)
  - Modal displays current usage, limit, tier-specific messaging, and direct link to pricing page
  - Integrated in `MoreAnalysesTab` for on-demand analysis quotas
  - Integrated in `FileUploader` for transcription upload quotas
  - All quota error codes properly detected and mapped to quota types
  - Fixed axios error interceptor to preserve original error structure (was transforming to plain objects)
  - Frontend now correctly detects HTTP 402 status and shows modal instead of generic "Upload failed"

### Added
- **Stripe Subscription Flow Documentation**: Comprehensive technical documentation for subscription system
  - Created `docs/STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_FLOW.md` with complete subscription lifecycle diagrams

  - Improved visual consistency across public-facing pages

### Fixed

### Fixed
- **Share Page Analysis Display**: Fixed share screen only showing "Full Transcript" tab without analyses
  - Made `AnalysisTabs` component work with both authenticated and unauthenticated contexts
  - Conditionally hide "More Analyses" tab on public share pages (requires authentication)
  - Conditionally hide translation feature on share pages (requires auth tokens)
  - Fixed backend `getSharedTranscription` to support both old format (`analyses`) and new format (`coreAnalyses`)
  - Share pages now correctly display all included analyses (Summary, Action Items, Communication Styles, etc.)
- **Next.js 15 Hydration Error**: Fixed `lang` attribute mismatch in share page layout
  - Root cause: Share page layout dynamically sets `lang` attribute based on `Accept-Language` header
  - Server-side language detection (from header) can differ from client-side, causing hydration mismatch
  - Applied `suppressHydrationWarning` to share layout `<html>` tag to suppress expected mismatch
  - Also applied to root layout per Next.js 15 recommendations
  - Fixed date rendering: moved `new Date().getFullYear()` to client-side useEffect
  - Added `mounted` state check to prevent rendering dates before client hydration
  - Fixed date formatting to ensure consistent output between server and client
