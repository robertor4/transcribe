## 7. Translation-Aware Corrections

### Overview
Intelligently update existing translations when transcript is corrected, avoiding full re-translation costs.

### Features
- **Selective Re-Translation:**
  - Detect which segments were modified in correction
  - Only re-translate changed segments (not entire transcript)
  - Merge updated segments back into existing translations

- **Change Propagation:**
  - After correction applied, show: "Update translations? (3 languages × 8 segments = ~$0.15)"
  - User can choose which languages to update
  - Option to skip and manually re-translate later

- **Smart Segment Matching:**
  - Use segment timestamps to match corrected text to translated segments
  - Preserve context by sending surrounding segments to translation API

- **Cost Optimization:**
  - Example: 5K word transcript fully translated = $2.50
  - Example: Re-translate only 50 words changed = $0.03 (98% savings)

### Technical Approach
```typescript
async updateTranslationsAfterCorrection(
  transcriptionId: string,
  changedSegments: number[], // Segment indices that were modified
  targetLanguages: string[]
): Promise<void> {
  for (const lang of targetLanguages) {
    const existingTranslation = await getTranslation(transcriptionId, lang);

    // Extract changed segments with context
    const segmentsToTranslate = extractSegmentsWithContext(changedSegments);

    // Translate only changed segments
    const updatedSegments = await translateSegments(segmentsToTranslate, lang);

    // Merge back into full translation
    const mergedTranslation = mergeSegments(existingTranslation, updatedSegments);

    // Save updated translation
    await saveTranslation(transcriptionId, lang, mergedTranslation);
  }
}
```

### Effort Estimate
- Backend: 6-8 hours (selective translation logic)
- Frontend: 3-4 hours (language selection UI)
- Testing: 3 hours
- **Total: 12-15 hours**

   - Which enhancements align with our 2026 product roadmap?
   - Are we targeting individual users or enterprise teams?
   - What's the budget for these enhancements? (Time + AI costs)

2. **User Research:**
   - Have we surveyed users about their biggest correction pain points?
   - Do users prefer AI-powered or manual find/replace?
   - Is speaker name management a blocker for purchasing?

3. **Competitive Analysis:**
   - What correction features do competitors offer?
   - Can we differentiate with any of these enhancements?

4. **Technical Constraints:**
   - Can our current infrastructure handle collaborative editing?
   - Do we have budget for ML model fine-tuning?
   - Are there limits on Firestore storage for version history?

5. **Compliance:**
   - Do we need HIPAA compliance for healthcare customers?
   - Are there legal requirements for audit logging?

## Conclusion

This document serves as a comprehensive backlog of ideas for enhancing the Transcript Correction feature. Not all enhancements are equal in priority or value - they should be evaluated based on user demand, business goals, and technical feasibility.

**Next Steps:**
1. Share this document with product team for prioritization
2. Conduct user research to validate assumptions
3. Create detailed specs for top 3-5 enhancements
4. Add prioritized items to 2026 roadmap
5. Assign effort estimates and resources

**Remember:** The current implementation (AI-powered correction with preview/apply workflow) is already a strong foundation. These enhancements should be added incrementally based on real user feedback, not all at once.
