## Script

### [0:00–0:03] COLD OPEN — The Loss

**Visual**: Dark screen (#22184C). A conference call ends — the familiar "beep" of a hangup. A waveform flatlines. Text fades in, white Merriweather:

> "What was decided about the pricing model in March?"

Beat. No answer. The text dissolves.

**VO**: "The call ends. The context disappears. Decisions, commitments, nuance — gone."

---

### [0:03–0:07] THE COST

**Visual**: Quick rhythm — three shots, one second each:

1. A Slack message: "Can someone send me the notes from Tuesday?"
2. An empty Google Doc titled "Client Call Notes — Q2" with a blinking cursor
3. A calendar full of back-to-back meetings, zooming out to reveal there's no time left

**VO**: "You spend hours rewriting what was already said. Your team waits. Your clients wait."

---

### [0:07–0:11] THE PROMISE

**Visual**: Hard cut to black. The Neural Summary logo fades in on #22184C. Above the headline, a DM Mono eyebrow in uppercase, tracked, #14D0DC:

> THE MEETING INTELLIGENCE PLATFORM

Below, the headline types out in Merriweather Black:

> **Every conversation, a *strategic asset.***

"strategic asset" renders in Merriweather Italic, glowing briefly in #14D0DC — exactly as it appears on the landing page hero.

**VO**: "Neural Summary. The meeting intelligence platform."

**Sound**: Single clean tone.

---

### [0:11–0:19] IN ACTION — CAPTURE

**Visual**: The product UI assembles on screen. The upload dropzone appears — a file labeled "Q2-board-review.m4a" is dragged in. The dashed border pulses #8D6AFA. A progress ring fills, segment by segment. Metadata populates in DM Mono (white/50): Duration: 52:14. Speakers: 4. Confidence: 96%.

Small text beneath: "No bots. No installs. No permissions popups."

Below, four platform icons float in: Google Meet, Teams, Zoom, and a generic audio waveform.

**VO**: "Upload a client call, a strategy session, a discovery interview. No meeting bot joins. No one knows you're recording."

---

### [0:19–0:30] IN ACTION — TRANSFORM

**Visual**: The three-pane layout snaps into place. The summary tab fills with structured content — Key Topics, Decisions, Action Items — each line appearing with a staggered fadeUp (120ms delays). Speaker labels appear in DM Mono semibold with color accents (Sarah in #c4aaff, Marcus in #5fd4a0).

Quick transition: The right panel slides open. Four persona-specific sequences, rapid-fire (1.5s each):

- **Sales** (#ff9f43) — A follow-up email generates. Subject line: "Re: Next steps on the enterprise deal"
- **Product** (#8D6AFA) — A PRD renders. Title: "Feature Brief: SSO Integration"
- **Marketing** (#14D0DC) — A blog post appears. Title: "What We Learned from 200 Customer Interviews"
- **Consulting** (#48c78e) — A client debrief fills in. Header: "Workshop Synthesis: Q3 Roadmap Alignment"

**VO**: "One recording becomes a follow-up email for your sales lead. A PRD for your product team. A blog post for marketing. A client debrief for your next stakeholder meeting."

---

### [0:30–0:39] IN ACTION — ASK

**Visual**: The Q&A panel slides open from the right. A question types itself:

> "What did the investors raise as objections?"

The AI answer appears with a smooth expand. Inline citation chips in DM Mono, #14D0DC on cyan-tinted background:

- "Concerns about CAC in enterprise" — ⏱ 33:47 · Investor A
- "Competitive moat question" — ⏱ 38:12 · Investor B

A second question types:

> "Who owns the launch timeline?"

Answer with timestamp. The timestamp chip is clicked — the transcript scrolls to that exact moment, highlighted.

**VO**: "Three weeks later, your co-founder asks what the investors said about CAC. You don't dig through notes. You ask — and get the exact moment, cited."

---

### [0:39–0:47] PROOF

**Visual**: Three testimonial cards slide in from bottom, staggered. Quotes in Merriweather Italic Light (300), white/60. Names in Geist Sans semibold. Roles in DM Mono, white/30, uppercase.

1. "3–4 hours saved per week on post-call writeups." — Elena Varga, Managing Partner
2. "Answer with a timestamp in 3 seconds. That's institutional memory." — Marcus Reinholt, CEO
3. "We shipped 40% faster last quarter." — Priya Chandra, Head of Product

Cards hold for 2 seconds, then compress into a single proof bar: "Trusted by 2,400+ founders, team leads & consultants"

**VO**: "Consultants use it to eliminate post-call writeups. Product teams turn discovery calls into specs. Founders build searchable company memory."

---

### [0:47–0:53] TRUST

**Visual**: Four security badges appear in a row with subtle glow animations — GDPR, Encrypted, Auto-Delete, Data Ownership. Stats count up beneath in Merriweather Black #14D0DC, labels in DM Mono tracked white/50:

- 99+ languages
- 96% accuracy
- 4x faster than real-time

**VO**: "Enterprise-grade security. 96% accuracy. A 60-minute meeting — transcribed, summarized, and actionable in under 15 minutes."

---

### [0:53–0:60] CLOSE — CTA

**Visual**: All UI elements pull back and converge into the Neural Summary logo on #22184C. The closing headline types out in Merriweather Bold:

> **Start turning conversations into *assets.***

"assets" in Merriweather Italic #14D0DC. A pill-shaped CTA button materializes: "Start for free" in Geist Sans semibold on #8D6AFA with a subtle pulse. Below it, four trust signals in DM Mono, small, tracked:

- Free 14-day trial
- No credit card needed
- No meeting bot
- Cancel anytime

**VO**: "If you run client calls, lead a product team, or sell for a living — stop rewriting what was already said."

Logo holds. Fade to black.
