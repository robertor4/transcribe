## ðŸ“ž Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**1. Webhook not receiving events:**
```bash
# Check webhook endpoint is accessible
curl https://your-domain.com/api/stripe/webhook

# Check Stripe dashboard for webhook errors
# Stripe Dashboard â†’ Developers â†’ Webhooks â†’ Click endpoint â†’ View logs

# Verify webhook secret matches
echo $STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
```

**2. Quota not enforcing:**
```bash
# Check SubscriptionGuard is applied to transcription endpoint
# apps/api/src/transcription/transcription.controller.ts
# Should have: @UseGuards(FirebaseAuthGuard, SubscriptionGuard)

# Check user's subscription tier in Firestore
# Should have: subscriptionTier: 'free' | 'professional' | 'payg'
```

**3. Usage not tracking:**
```bash
# Check logs for usage tracking
pm2 logs api | grep "Usage tracked"

# Check Firestore collection: usageRecords
# Should have new documents after each transcription

# Check user's usageThisMonth field
# Should increment after each transcription
```

**4. Checkout session not creating:**
```bash
# Check Stripe API key is set
echo $STRIPE_SECRET_KEY

# Check price IDs are correct
echo $STRIPE_PRICE_PROF_MONTHLY

# Test endpoint manually
