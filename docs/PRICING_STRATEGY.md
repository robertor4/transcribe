## Pricing Psychology & Optimization

### 1. Anchoring Strategy

```

- Show Business tier first (anchor high)
- Highlight Professional as "Most Popular"
- Makes $29 feel like excellent value
- Free tier shows we're generous/confident

### 2. Value Metric Clarity

"**Hours of audio**" is the unit:
- Clear and relatable (users know how many meetings they have)
- Easy to predict needs (4 meetings/week √ó 1 hour = 16 hours/month)
- Scales with value delivered (more hours = more value)

Alternative metrics considered but rejected:
- ‚ùå Per-minute pricing (feels like watching the meter)
- ‚ùå Per-transcription (files vary wildly in length)
- ‚ùå Per-user (doesn't match individual use case)

### 3. Good-Better-Best Framework

**Target Distribution:**
- 60% choose Professional (sweet spot)
- 30% choose Business (power users)
- 10% choose Enterprise (custom needs)

**Why This Works:**
- Professional tier has best value per dollar

- Enterprise is aspirational/exclusive

### 4. Annual Discount

**Marketing:**

- "Get 2 months free"
- "Lock in this price for 12 months"

### 5. Usage Safety Net

**"Never Run Out" Messaging:**

Professional tier (60 hours/month):
- Overage: Just $0.50/hour (vs $1.50 PAYG)
- No surprise bills - email alert at 80% usage
- Option to upgrade to Business tier mid-month (prorated)

**Psychology:**
- Reduces anxiety about overages
- Overage price is fair (cheaper than PAYG)
- Encourages upgrade to Business tier

### 6. Social Proof & Defaults

**On Pricing Page:**
- "Join 500+ professionals who trust Neural Summary"
- "Most Popular" badge on Professional tier
- Testimonials from target personas
- Trust badges (SOC 2 in progress, GDPR compliant)

**Defaults:**
