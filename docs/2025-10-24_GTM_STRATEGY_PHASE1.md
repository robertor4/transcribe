Response: "Great question! Neural Summary is built for professionals who need more than basic transcripts. We offer 15 specialized analysis templates (e.g., executive briefings, blog post outlines, emotional intelligence reports) vs Otter's basic summaries. We also support unlimited file size (up to 5GB), translation to 15 languages, and advanced sharing features. Pricing: Our Professional plan ($29/month for 60 hours) is more expensive than Otter Pro ($17 for 20 hours), but we deliver better value at scale ($0.48/hour vs $0.85/hour)."

**"What file formats do you support?"**
Response: "We support M4A, MP3, WAV, MP4, MPEG, MPGA, WebM, FLAC, and OGG. Max file size: 100MB (Free), 5GB (Professional). Max duration: 30 minutes (Free), unlimited (Professional)."

**"How accurate is the transcription?"**
Response: "We use AssemblyAI (primary) and OpenAI Whisper (fallback) for transcription, which deliver 90-95% accuracy for clear audio. Accuracy depends on audio quality, speaker clarity, and background noise. We also support speaker diarization (who said what)."

**"Can I translate transcriptions to other languages?"**
Response: "Yes! Professional users can translate transcriptions and analyses to 15 languages (including Spanish, French, German, Dutch, Chinese, Japanese, etc.). Translation is available for all analysis types."

**"What happens if I exceed my monthly hours?"**
Response: "No problem! Overages are automatically charged at $0.50/hour (Professional) or $0.40/hour (Business). You'll receive an email notification when you reach 80% of your limit. You can also upgrade your plan anytime."

**"Do you offer refunds?"**
Response: "Yes, we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee on your first payment. If you're not satisfied, contact us at support@neuralsummary.com for a full refund."

## Risk Assessment & Contingency Plans

### Risk 1: Low Free-to-Paid Conversion (<5%)

**Indicators:**
- Activation rate low (<40%)
- Users not engaging with key features
- Drop-off at upgrade prompts

**Contingency Actions:**
1. Improve onboarding flow (better guidance, tooltips)
2. Add upgrade prompts at key moments (after great result, before limit)
3. Offer extended trial (7 days Professional free)
4. Conduct user interviews to understand blockers
5. A/B test pricing ($29 vs $19 vs $39)

---

### Risk 2: High Churn (>10%)

**Indicators:**
- Customers canceling after 1-2 months
- Low usage (few transcriptions per month)
- Negative feedback (NPS <20)

**Contingency Actions:**
1. Exit interviews: Ask "Why are you leaving?"
2. Offer pause subscription (instead of cancel)
3. Counter-offer: Discount for 3 months
4. Improve product: Fix reported issues, add requested features
5. Reassess pricing: Consider lower-tier option ($15/month, 20 hours)

---

### Risk 3: CAC Too High (>$150)

**Indicators:**
- Paid channels not converting (LinkedIn ads, etc.)
- High traffic, low signups
- Signups not activating

**Contingency Actions:**
1. Double down on organic channels (SEO, content, community)
2. Pause paid ads temporarily
3. Improve landing page conversion rate (A/B tests)
4. Refine targeting (focus on highest-converting personas)
5. Leverage referral program (lower CAC through word-of-mouth)

---

### Risk 4: Product Hunt Flop (<100 Signups)

**Indicators:**
- Low upvotes (<200)
- Low engagement (few comments)
- Traffic spike but low signups

**Contingency Actions:**
1. Don't panic—PH is just one channel
2. Analyze what went wrong (timing, messaging, product fit)
3. Focus on other channels (LinkedIn, SEO, outreach)
4. Relaunch in 6 months with improved product + momentum
5. Consider alternative launch platforms (Hacker News, BetaList)

---

### Risk 5: Founder Burnout

**Indicators:**
- Working >60 hours/week consistently
- Neglecting health, relationships
- Losing motivation, excitement

**Contingency Actions:**
1. Prioritize ruthlessly: Cut low-impact activities
2. Automate/delegate: Use tools, consider VA for admin tasks
3. Set boundaries: No work after 7pm, weekends off
4. Take breaks: 1 day off per week minimum
5. Seek support: Co-founder, mentor, therapist, community

### LinkedIn Post Templates

#### Behind-the-Scenes Post
"Building Neural Summary has been a wild ride.

3 months ago, I was spending 12+ hours/week taking notes in client meetings.

I thought: "There has to be a better way."

So I built one.

Today, Neural Summary helps consultants, coaches, and founders save 10+ hours/week on documentation.

Here's what I learned:

1. [Lesson 1 - e.g., "Solve your own problem first"]
2. [Lesson 2 - e.g., "Talk to 50+ customers before building"]
3. [Lesson 3 - e.g., "Launch before you're ready"]

What's been your biggest lesson building [something]?"

2. Upload to Neural Summary
3. Get summary + action items in 5 minutes

Why this works:

**Subject:** Quick question about client documentation, [First Name]

Hi [First Name],

I came across your [LinkedIn post/article] about [specific topic related to consulting/client work].
